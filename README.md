Description:

The business context of this project revolves around the development and comprehension of crystalline materials, specifically in the areas of design, manufacturing, and quality control. The primary goal is to enable the swift interpretation of X-ray images, which are crucial for understanding microscopic structure and optimising material properties. Industries such as semiconductors, energy storage, pharmaceuticals, ceramics, agrochemicals, and thin-film materials can benefit from this project, as it addresses research, manufacturing, engineering, quality control, and patent-related aspects. The challenge lies in automating the interpretation of X-ray images, which currently relies on physical modelling and analysis expertise. The objective is to streamline the development cycle by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) with simulated X-ray images, taking inspiration from similar CNN applications in analysing biological samples.
